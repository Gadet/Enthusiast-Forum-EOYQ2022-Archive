Today things seem a little bit cleaer
I catch myself lookin' in the mirror
Finally I see her
No I don't wanna waste our time
But baby I can't deny
I'm glad I got to take this ride
With you
We could blame it on the timin' and location and the fightin', the growin' up
But baby we'd be lyin', we held each other down
So stand up, stand up, stand up
We could work it but we tried it, not worth it, to fight it, this faded love
Stuck inside a rhythm, just take a look around
Stand up, stand up, stand up
One week and I feel so free
Spent a minute talkin' two you
But it feels like three
It's four the best now we both agree
It's alright, take five for some time to breathe
I know we're on the right track
Now you can get your life back yeah
So happy that we tried that
No I don't wanna waste our time
But baby I can't deny
I'm glad I got to take this ride
With you~oh
We could blame it on the timin' and location and the fightin', the growin' up
But baby we'd be lyin', we held each other down
So stand up, stand up, stand up
We could work it but we tried it, not worth it to fight it, this faded love
Stuck inside a rhythm, just take a look around
So stand up, stand up, stand up,
Come on baby stand up
Stand up, stand up
Stand up
Won't you~
Come on, you know you gotta, gotta stand up
Stand up, stand up
