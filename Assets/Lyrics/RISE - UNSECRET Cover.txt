Welcome to the wild, no heroes and villains
Welcome to the war, we've only begun
So pick up your weapon and face it
There's blood on the crown, go and take it
You get one shot to make it out alive, so
Higher and higher you chase it
It's deep in your bones, go and take it
This is your moment
Now is your time, so
Prove yourself and
Rise, rise
Make 'em remember you
Rise
Push through hell and
Rise, rise
They will remember you
Rise
Welcome to the climb up
Reach for the summit
Visions pray that one false step lead the end, so
Higher and higher you chase it
It's deep in your blood, go and take it
This is your moment
Take to the skies, go
Prove yourself and
Rise, rise
Make 'em remember you
Rise
Push through hell and
Rise, rise
They will remember you
Rise
So get along, so get along, go
Get along-long, get a move on up
So get along, so get along, go
Get along-long, get a move on up
And as you fight among the death beneath the dirt
Do you know yet? Do you want it?
And when the giants call and ask you what you're worth
Do you know if win or die, you'll
Prove yourself and
Rise, rise
Make 'em remember you
Rise
Push through hell and
Rise, rise
They will remember you
Rise
Prove yourself and
Rise, rise
(Pick up your weapon and face it)
Make 'em remember you
Rise
(It's deep in your blood, go and take it)
Push through hell and
Rise, rise
(Pick up your weapon and face it)
They will remember you
Rise
