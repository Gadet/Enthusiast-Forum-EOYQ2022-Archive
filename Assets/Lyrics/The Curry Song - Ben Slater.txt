Yo
This song going out to Sanjay
I said turn that bloody music down!
Not (?) yeah!
TURN IT DOWN!
I never... had a curry like you before and
I just lost you
Fuck me, man
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey
Less of the language, yeah?
I woke up in the middle of the night (night)
And I noticed that I wanted a curry (wanted a curry)
So I phoned up the curry shop (curry shop)
Asked for a curry (curry)
And sent a delivery to me
It came about half past twelve
And I paid for the curry it was five pounds (five pounds)
What a rip off I do say (what a rip off)
Plus the man was gay
Who brought my curry (my curry)
He brought my curry (brought my curry)
? (?)
Extra onion (extra onion)
Chapatis (chapatis)
A three piece of naan bread (piece of naan bread)
What can you do now (what can you do now)
Go back to bed (BACK TO BED YOU BASTARD!)
Spilt curry on my top (top)
So I put it straight into the washing machine (washing machine)
Didn't know it was a curry stain
It was very sweaty (sweaty)
It was orange too (orange stain)
Tried wiping it off with a dish cloth
It would not work so I put it in the washer (the washer)
It only cost 50p (50p)
But it was from Netto
And I like curry (like curry)
Where is my curry (where is my curry)
My curry is freezing (my curry is freezing)
Warm it up (warm it up you BASTARD!)
Put it (put it)
In the microwave (in the microwave)
You sweaty son of (sweaty son of)
Son of a bitch (son of a bitch)
(Speaks an Indian language (likely Hindi) followed by gibbberish)
I went to-to the shop
To get some Chapatis (chapatis)
With extra spice
And extra curry
To make it up big nice (big nice)
What the fuck are they talking about right now
