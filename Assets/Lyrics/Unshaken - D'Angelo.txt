May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst a crashing world
Did I hear a thunder?
Did I hear you break?
I can't quite remember
Just what guided this way, oh
May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst a crashing world
The pines, they often whisper
They whisper what no tongue can tell
He who drinks from the deep water
May he know the depths of the well
Well
May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst a crashing world
May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst a crashing world
Mmm, oh, traveler
What have you seen?
Where there crossroads
Where you been, where you been?
I once was standing tall
Now I feel my back's against the wall
May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst a crashing world
May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst a crashing world
~
The morning light
When it comes to me
It was there but I could not see
Am I to wander
As a wayward son?
Will the hunter be hunted
By the smoking gun?
May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst a crashing world
May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst a crashing world
May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst a crashing world
