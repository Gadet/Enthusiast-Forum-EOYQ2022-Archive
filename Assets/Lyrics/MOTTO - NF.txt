I could write a record full of radio songs
Do a bunch of features that my label would love
Do a bunch of features that I don't even like
Just to build up the hype, yeah
I could sell my house and move out to LA
Get inside of rooms with the biggest of names
Hire fifty people just to give me advice
On the way I should write (Oh, God)
Yeah, sounds like a nightmare if you ask me
Yeah, went from my bedroom to the big leagues
You know how many times that I was told things
Wouldn't work? But worked out, havin' cold feet
Didn't keep me from success, but delayed it some
I used to be the guy who'd kill to get a number one
I had to hear "That song's a hit" before I thought it was
But nowadays I don't really give aâ€” (What?)
Oh, God (Yeah)
Might catch me at the award show
Eatin' popcorn in the back row
Catchin' Zs with my hat low
No nominations, but it's cool though
Oh, God
You might see me in the same clothes
I had on last week, am I ashamed? No (Yeah)
You heard the sayin', "If it ain't broke
Don't fix it," that's my motto
Yeah, I miss buyin' CDs at the store
And thumbin' through the cases tryin' to make a choice (Yeah)
That don't make no sense to you? Well, of course
See, one man's inconvenience is another's joy
Wow, wow, how are you unemployed
Tellin' me to get a life? You should look at yours (Yup)
Congratulations, you can raise your voice
Hope you break both of your legs fallin' off your horse
(Oh, snap) This is the industry
Where it ain't how big you are, it's how big you seem
Where people sacrifice the art tryin' to chase a dream
Then they wonder why they music's lackin' creativity
(Oh, yeah) Would've gave anything
To be respected by the artist I was listening
To, but not no more, them days are history
Skip the red carpet, you lookin' for me?
Oh, God (Yeah)
You might catch me at the award show
Eatin' popcorn in the back row
Catchin' Zs with my hat low
No nominations, but it's cool though
Oh, God
You might see me in the same clothes
I had on last week, am I ashamed? No (Yeah)
You heard the sayin', "If it ain't broke
Don't fix it," that's my motto
Got my feet propped up
Leave my shirts untucked
I'm the boss, so what?
I do what I want (Oh, God)
You got the trophy, that's great
I'm happy for you, no hate
Still got a smile on my face
Chillin' in the back like, "Hey"
Oh, God (Yeah)
You might catch me at the award show
Eatin' popcorn in the back row
Catchin' Zs with my hat low
No nominations, but it's cool though
Oh, God
You might see me in the same clothes
I had on last week, am I ashamed? No (Yeah)
You heard the sayin', "If it ain't broke
Don't fix it," that's my motto
